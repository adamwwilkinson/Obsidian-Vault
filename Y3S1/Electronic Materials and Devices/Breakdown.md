Not a breakdown of materials, but rather a functional breakdown whose affects can be reversed.
### Zener Breakdown

Tunnelling can occur with a narrow barrier. The more doping you put in, the width of the depletion region decreases, thinning the barrier, and the electric field is increased.

Once you reach a reverse bias voltage greater than the *avalanche voltage* you will get a huge amount of current.

We can use this to keep a constant voltage at a node. A 5.1V zener connected to ground will keep the voltage at that node at 5.1V, regardless of resistance and power supply.

### Avalanche Breakdown
Before damaging the substrate and bonds, the electric field is so strong that electrons are accelerated to high energies, and can knock electrons out of the lattice, creating more electron-hole pairs.

#### Application
One photon comes in, creates an electron-hole pair, and the electric field accelerates the electron to ionise more atoms, creating more electron-hole pairs, and so on.

In extremely low intensity light, this can be used to create very sensitive photon detectors.

### Charge Storage
In reverse bias, the width of the depletion region increases acting as a capacitor.
There is also a capacitance effect in forward bias, and current only flows when charge is stored, in forward bias this happens so quickly its hardly noticeble.
Forward bias we are injecting majority carriers from one side into the other side to become minority carriers.

So a diode in forward bias then turned into reverse bias as it takes a while for the charge to dissapear, as barely an current is flowing.

This means a real diode device looks like this,
