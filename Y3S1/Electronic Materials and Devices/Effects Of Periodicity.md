### Ek Curves

```ad-info
The slope of the curve relates to the sign of the charge of the particle, for a free particle, the slope is proportional to the sign and magnitude of the charge.

If the slope of the curve is positive, it's particle has positive charge. This is because the energy of the particle increases as it's momentum increases, consistnent with a particle of positive charge.

```ad-info
You can tell is a particle has a relatively large mobility by how pronouced it's curvature is. This is because a more pronounced curvature means a smaller effective mass, which means a larger movility. The effective mass is proportional to the inverse of the curvature of the energy curve.

The weird gaps where the wave number ($k$) is $\frac \pi a$ is because it is where the wave length is *a* i.e. the length of the gap between atoms. At some places it's sat right on the nucleus, where it's hard to escape or it's sat between two nucleus where it's quite easy to escape.

Look at [[Periodic One-dimensional Lattice#Brillouin Zone]],

The difference in energy levels, changes the colour given off by the photon. We can change these energy levels by adjusting the length of the well.

### Fermi Level
![[Effects Of Periodicity-1679732343385.jpeg]]
With the left diagram there, at 0K, once all the electrons are filled in a metal, there is an $E_F$ which caps and prevents any more electrons. This is called the *Fermi level*. If energy is given to the system now, only those electrons at the *Fermi level* can raise higher in the band, as they've got the space to. Unlike the electrons below them.

This was one reason our classical [[Drude Model]] didn't work. As there, we treated electrons independent of each other.

```ad-info
When the Fermi level is in the condunction band, it is a condunctor. When the Fermi level is very far from the condunction band, it is an insulator. When the Fermi level is out the conduntion band, but very close to it, this is a semiconductor.

### Effective Mass
The group velocity of the wave function gives the velocity of the electron $\frac {\partial \omega} {\partial k}$. Given that for electrons $E = \hbar \omega$, the group velocity of the electron is given,
$$v_g = \frac 1 {\hbar} \frac {\partial E} {\partial k}$$

The acceleration is,
$$a = \frac {dv_g} {dt} = \frac 1 {\hbar} \frac {\partial^2 E} {\partial k^2} \frac {dk} {dt}$$

```ad-tip
Remember $k$ is the wave number.
```

Multiplying this by the mass of the electron $m^*$ we can get the force on the electron. The force is related to rate of change of momentum.

$$F = \frac {dp} {dt} = \hbar \frac {dk} {dt}$$

With *Newton's law*, we can define mass of electron in the periodic lattice as,
$$m^* = \frac{\hbar^2}{\frac {\partial^2 E} {\partial k^2}}$$

We can see here the second derivative of the *conduction band* is positive which means the mass is positive. The larger the curvature, the lower the mass. This means the mass of the electron in the *valence band* is negative, which is odd and this means it moves like a positive charge.
