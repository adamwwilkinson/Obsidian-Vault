Understanding the design of the PN-junction, and the MOSFET.
Understand what assumptions needed and what components of the equations for each device.

### PN
Working out current, electric field, and other things.

### MOSFET
Given parameters of MOSFET, or work out what parameters should be depending on use case.

NO QUANTUM

### PN Revisited
Applying a forward bias reduces the barrier height. The relationship between the barrier height and the applied voltage is exponential.

Quasi Fermi energies are equal in equilibrium, applying a bias moves in a direction where the electric field barrier for majority carriers are reduced.

At equilibirum there is a perfect balance between the diffusion of electrons and holes, and the drift of electrons and holes. By reducing the barrier we are allowing more majority carriers to cross the barrier.

In P the majority carriers are holes. Lowering the barrier moves the holes to the right where they would accumalate and diffuse.

Because of recombination the population density of holes is exponential.
