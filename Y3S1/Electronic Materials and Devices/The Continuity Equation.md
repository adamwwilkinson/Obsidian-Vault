What goes in must go out.

If given a box, we can say the flow of charges in the box is given by $J_p(x) - J_n(x)$ and the flow out is given by $J_p(x + dx) - J_n(x + dx)$.

### Relationship between Viscosity and Diffusion
$$D = BkT$$
Where $B$ is viscosity, $k$ is Boltzmann constant and $T$ is absolute temperature.

In electronic conduction $B = \frac {\mu} {e}$
