### Full Range Leadership Model
Lots of ways to understand 'effective' leadership.
Three styles:
- laissez faire
- transactional
- transformational

### Laissez Faire Leadership Role
A passive, non-leader
Withdrawn in their role and provides little support or direction

### Transactional Leadership
Based on providing rewards, or threatening with punishment
Clear goals, structures, and expectations
Monitor closely
Promotes performance, but maybe not for the right reasons

### Transformational Leadership
Motivates followers to achieve goals that extend beyond self-interest
Leads with charisma and sets high expectations
