### Reciprocation
We try to repay what another person has provided us.
After making a 'big' request, we follow up with a smaller request.

### Commitment and Consistency
After making a choice we encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.

### Liking
We prefer to say yes to those we know and like.

### Social Proof
We determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct.

### Authority
We may make decisions based on the authority of others.

### Scarcity
Opportunities seem more valuable to us when they are less available.

### Unity
We like to feel part of a shared identity.
