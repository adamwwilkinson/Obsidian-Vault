### Review of some Physics Laws
#### Faraday's Law of Magnetic Induction
The induced emd from the change of magnetic flux over time, multipled by the $N$ loops of wire are:
$$\epsilon = - N \frac {\mathrm d \Phi_B} {\mathrm d t}$$

Looking at the result below we can rewrite,
$$\epsilon = - N \times B$$

Where magnetic flux is,
$$\Phi_B = \int \overrightarrow B \; \mathrm d \overrightarrow A$$

$$\Phi_B = \int \vert \overrightarrow B \vert \times \vert \mathrm d \overrightarrow A \vert \times \sin \theta$$
