### Capacitors
Stores energy in an electric field. #todo/excalidraw
Capacitance relates the voltage $v$ applied to the charge $q$ generated,
$$C = \frac{q}{v}$$
$$i = \frac{\mathrm dq}{\mathrm dt} = C \frac{\mathrm dv}{\mathrm dt}$$
$$E(t) = C \times \frac{v^2_{c(t)}}{2}$$

When connected directly to an ideal voltage source, 
an ideal capacitor with have a non-zero current onluy when the voltage is changing.

#### Unit of Capacitance
Measured in **Farad** $(F)$
