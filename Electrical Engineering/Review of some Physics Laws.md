### Faraday's Law of Magnetic Induction
The induced EMF from the change of magnetic flux over time, multipled by the $N$ loops of wire are:
$$\epsilon = - N \frac {\mathrm d \Phi_{B}} {\mathrm d t}$$

Looking at the result below we can rewrite,
$$\epsilon = - N \frac {\mathrm d \int \overrightarrow B \; \mathrm d \overrightarrow A} {\mathrm d t}$$

Where magnetic flux is,
$$\Phi_{B} = \int \overrightarrow B \; \mathrm d \overrightarrow A$$

$$\Phi_{B} = \int \vert \overrightarrow B \vert \times \vert \mathrm d \overrightarrow A \vert \times \sin \theta$$

### Lenz's Law
The induced EMF always gives rise to a current whose magnetic field opposes the change in magnetic flux. 

### Ways to Induce an EMF
- change $B$
- change the area of the loop in the field
- change the orientation of the loop in the field 

```ad-note
For displaying whether flux goes into the page, a cross is used, while if it's going out, a dot is used instead.

### Lorentz Force Law
A current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic and electric field experiences a force called the Lorentz force.

You can tell the direction of the force by laying your *left* hand flat with your palm against the direction of the magnetic field, the fingers pointed with the current, and the force experienced will be directed with the thumb.

### Ampere's Law
Relates a net magnetic field along a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop.

$$B = \frac {\mu_0 I} {2 \pi r}$$

$\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \frac {T \times m} {A}$ and is the permeability of free space.
