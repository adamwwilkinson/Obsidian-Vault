### Branches and Nodes
Each 2-terminal circuit element is designated as a **branch**. Each terminal of a branch is a **node**. If a node connects to another node without any electronic components between, the two nodes can be merged.

### Parallel or Series?
If a node is shared exclusively by two electronic components, then they are in **series**.
If a common node is shared on both side of electronic components, then they are in **parallel**.
