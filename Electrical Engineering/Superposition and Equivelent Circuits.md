Volt-meters: measures voltage across a device, to be accurate need $R_M \gg R_2$ where $R_M$ is the resistance of the meter. This is because,
$$V_2 = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_S$$


Current-meters: measures current through a device, to be accurate $R_M \ll R_2$ where $R_M$ is the resistance of the meter.
