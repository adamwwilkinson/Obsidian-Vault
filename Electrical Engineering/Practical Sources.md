### Practical Voltage Sources
#### Representation 
Can be represented with an ideal voltage is placed in series with a resistor.
$V_t \neq V_S$ where $V_t$ is the voltage of the power source's terminals.
$$V_t=\frac{R_A}{R_A + R}V_S,$$ where $R_A$ is the resistance of the network.

$V_t = V_S - V_R$
