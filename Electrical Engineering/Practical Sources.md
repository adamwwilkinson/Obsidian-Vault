### Practical Voltage Sources
#### Representation 
Can be represented with an ideal voltage source is placed in series with a resistor.
$V_t \neq V_S$ where $V_t$ is the voltage of the power source's terminals.
$$V_t=\frac{R_A}{R_A + R}V_S,$$ where $R_A$ is the resistance of the network.

$V_t = V_S - V_R$

### Practical Current Sources
#### Representation 
Can be represented with an ideal current source is placed in parallel with a resistor.

$i_S = i_R + i_A$, we want to minimise $i_R$.

$$i_A = \frac{R}{R_A + R}i_S$$
