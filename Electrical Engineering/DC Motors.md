### What
Motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy for use elsewhere.

#### Parts
- rotor: rotating part of the motor
- stator: stationary part of the motor
- stator magnets: provides an opposing set of fixed magnetic poles
- armature: consist of a set of wire-wound coils, energised such that the opposing coils provide additive torque
- commutator: consist of a metal split-ring such that each segment if electrically isolated from the others
- the armature coils are attached electrically to the segments of the commutator such that opposing coils are energised oppositely
- brushes: provide electrical contact to the commutator segments
