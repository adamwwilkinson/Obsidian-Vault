Values for [[Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering#Voltage|voltage]] and [[Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering#Current|current]] is time dependent.

### Instantaneous, Peak, Average Power
#### Instantaneous Power
$$P(t) = v(t)i(t)$$

#### Root-mean-square
A measure of the average signal.

```ad-warning
As the signal spends as much time above 0 as it does below, it gives the illusion that the signal carries zero net power.
$P(t) = \frac {v^2(t)} {R}$; power is proportional to the square of the voltage, which means the power is always above zero.
