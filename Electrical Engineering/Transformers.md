### What
An AC device to change high voltage low current into low voltage high current without changing the frequency.

It accomplishes this using electromagnetic induction.

### Induction Theory
Based on [[review of some physics laws#faradays law of magnetic induction]].

### Working Principle of a Transformer
1. When the current in the primary coil changes (AC), a changing magnetic field is produced.
2. The magnetic flux linked with the secondary coil changes.
3. This induces a EMF in the secondary coil.

### Primary and Secondary Relationship
The *turns ratio (n)* is defined as the ratio of turns in the secondary windings, to the turns in the primary windings.

$$\frac {V_{s}} {V_{p}} = \frac {N_{s}} {N_{p}} = \frac {i_{p}} {i_{s}} = n$$

```ad-note
n > 1, is a step up transformer (increase voltage)
n < 1, is a step down transformer (decrease voltage)
```

```ad-note
Notice how the current is flipped.
```
