All the previous work done before were dc-circuits. Sinusoidal steady-state now says the voltage is time dependent, and in the shape of a sinusoidal wave.

### Sinusoidal Sources #todo make Title? Make current title topic?

### Harmonic Signals
A signal that can be represented as a sinusoid.
Can be mathematically defined as,
$$s(t) = A \sin (\omega t + \phi)$$
$\omega$ is angular frequency, or how fast the wave changes. Measured in radian/s. Given by $2\pi f$.
$f$ is the frequency and is measured in HZ. Given by $\frac 1 T$
$T$ is the period and is measured in seconds.
$\phi$ is the phase shift. #todo

### RMS
Root Mean Square, or the effective value of a signal.
$A = \sqrt 2 A_{rms}$
```ad-info
Only true for sinusoidal waves.
```

### Important Relationships
#### Sine-cosine Relationships
$$A \cos(\omega t) = A \sin(\omega t + \frac \pi 2)$$

#### Derivatives
Just know the derivatives bro it aint that hard.

### Phase Lead and Lag
We can say that the phase of the cosine leads the sine by $\frac \pi 2$, or we can say sine lags behind by $\frac \pi 2$.
We usually say the signal that hits it's peak first is the one leading.

### Complex Numbers
The number that solves the equation $i^2 = -1$ is an imaginary number called $i$.
This allows us to solve complex equations with no traditional solution.

#### Argand Plane
A plane where the vertical axis is the imaginary part of the number, and the horizontal axis is the real part of a number.
This gives us a cartesian representation, $z = x + iy$ or $(x, y)$.
We can also represent it with a polar format $(r, \theta)$. With $x = r \cos \theta, \ y = r \sin \theta$.
This is also equivalent to the exponential form $z = r \exp ^{i \theta}$.
