### Power (Again)
$$P = vi + Q \frac {\mathrm d v} {\mathrm d t}$$
Made up of the electrodynamic term, and the electrostatic term respectively.

Ignoring the static term, which we can only do for [[DC]] circuits and [[Resistors]]
$$P = vi$$


### Power in a Resistor (dissapation)
$$P = i^2R$$
$$P = \frac {v^2} {R}$$
