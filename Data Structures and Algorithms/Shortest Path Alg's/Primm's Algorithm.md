# Prim's Algorithm
[[Shortest Path Algorithms]]. Given a priority tree, construct a spanning tree. Can be expressed as priority-first search by observing the priority of a vertex is the weight of the shortest edge joining the vertex to the rest of the tree. 
Impemented as a [[Shortest Path Algorithms#Priority-first Search|PFS]] by replacing *PRIORITY* with *weight(u, v)*.
