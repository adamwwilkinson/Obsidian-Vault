# Data Structures
Data structures allow data to be store, organized, and accessed.

### Why
Software is complex, world is unpredictable, and clients are unpredictable. For this reason, software should be correct, efficient, easy to maintain and reusable.

### Abstract Data Types
Don't need to understand how something works, just that it works.
