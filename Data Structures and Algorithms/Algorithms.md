# Algorithms
Well-defined *set of rules* that specify a sequential series of operations to be applied to an input, which then produces an output.

### Design and Analysis
Few questions to keep in mind:
	1. *What* is the *problem* to solve?
	2. Does a solution *exist*?
	3. Can we find a solution (algorithm), and is there *more* *than* *one* solution?
	4. Is the algorithm *correct*?
	5. How *efficient* is the algorithm?

### Evaluating Algorithms
This includes how correct they are, and how efficient they are.

#### Correctness
There are two main ways to prove correctness, by induction, and by contradiction.

#### Efficiency
An efficient algorithm minimises time, and space (memory). In most situations there is a time-space trade off which exist
