# Crankshaft
Made of *cast iron*, or *forged steel*. If the parting line is thinner than it's made of cast iron. Needs to be *balanced*.

### Parts
- *journal* (the inner part of the bearings)
	- *main journals* are clamped in crankcase
	- *rod journals* in between main journal
- *webs* that join journals
- *counterweights* at the end of webs

### Definitions
*Crank radius* - the offset from the center line to the center of the journals
*Stroke* - twice the crank radius and determines the engine capacity

### Main Caps
A bearing shell is placed between the main cap and crankshaft during installation. They are formed together and thus *need to be paired* in the correct order.

### Main Bearings
The *hole in the bearing* and the cap is *for oil pressure* (dictated by clearance), this separates the journal from the bearing. These *bearing are made of softer metal* to take the wear in the event of metal-metal contact. Only the bottom of the bearings have a groove for the oil.

### Lubrication
The rod journals run on a thin film of oil that comes through passageways drilled in the crankcase. Oil is also flung around the crankcase passively. *Thrust washers* are placed on the side of bearing shells to *reduce end play*.

### Installation
- paint assembly lube on to bearing shells
- install thrust washers
- place in crankshaft
- mallet top caps
- screw in main caps
- screw down in spiral patterns

### Faults and Upgrades
*Low oil pressure* can cause wear. *Fatigue* also occurs between webs and journals. Install a stronger crankshaft if you are getting a more powerful engine, another option is a *stroker crankshaft* which is a shaft with a longer radius (comes in a kit), Can also get new pistons.
