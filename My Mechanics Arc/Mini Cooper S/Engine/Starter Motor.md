# Starter Motor
### Why?
All internal combustion engines need help to get moving, as we need to reach a power stroke for an engine to be self-sufficient.

### Parts
*Pinion* - small gear to turn over engine, meshes with the [[Flywheel]].


### How
Planetary gear set is used to reduce the speed, and increase the torque to drive the flywheel.

### Power
The starter motor easily draws the most amount of power compared to any other electrical appliance in the car. Starter is designed in short burst and not endurance. Uses a [[Solenoid]] to turn on.

#### The Cable
Thickest cable in the car usually connects to the [[Starter Motor]].
