# Engine Mount
Or transmission mount attaches engine to the rest of the car. Complicated problem as engine is vibrating due to all the mechanical movement within the engine. The engine constantly wants to twist in it's mounts. The engine mounts need to restrain the movement of the engine and dampen the motion.

### NVH
Noise vibration and harshness or (NVH). Harshness is the measure of how good noise and vibration. E.g. a purring engine feels good, where as a whining engine feels bad.

### [[Drivetrain]]
Completely isolated from the rest of the bodywork. No solid metal connections, instead there is a soft damper at every connection points.

### Vibration and Bouncing
The engine mount should be able to handle both these conditions. Resistant to bouncing, but soft to vibrating. Vibration comes from within the engine, while bouncing comes from external forces such as the road.


### Failure Mode
As with all rubber parts, they deteriorate with age. This leads to cracks and loss of dampening capacity (causing vibrations through the car), or the mount becomes weak (causing rocking through the car). Knocking noises in the engine bay indicate the need for a mount change.
