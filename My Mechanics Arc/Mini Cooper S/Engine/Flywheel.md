# Flywheel
**Heavy**. Bolts onto the [[Crankshaft|crankshaft]] in order to smooth the [[Crankshaft|crankshafts]] motion.

### The four-stroke Cycle
Only one of the four stokes generate power, the *power stroke*. This means the rotational velocity of the [[Crankshaft|crankshaft]] varies as it goes around. If it doesn't have enough energy the car stalls. With the heavy flywheel, it takes away some of the energy of the power stroke in order to turn the flywheel, and as the [[Crankshaft|crankshaft]] loses energy, the fly wheel comes back to keep it moving. The more cylinders a engine has the smoother the crankshaft's motion.

### Usefulness
Most useful at low speeds, low revs as high speeds the wheels act like flywheels as the wheels help turn the engine.

### Size and Geometry
The more cylinders an engine has, the smaller the fly wheel. Holes are drilled into the flywheel in order to be balanced. Teeth are also there to engage with the [[Starter Motor]] and get the engine started.

### Upgrades?
A lighter flywheel can be installed to quicken the rate the revs raise or fall, but this means a rougher idle and easier to stall.
