# Solenoid
Princepal behind a [[Solenoid]] is a small current affecting a larger current.

### What
A tight coil of wile with a spring that generates a magnetic force when powered on, pulling a large iron core into it. The spring pushes the core away when switched off. This may be used to create contact between the larger circuit and close it. 

#### One-way clutch
To ensure the flywheel doesn't drive the motor a *sprag clutch* is used to ensure force only carries one way.

### Ignition
There's a nylon pin on the plunger that connects to the pinion to take it out the way of the motor when ignition is off.
