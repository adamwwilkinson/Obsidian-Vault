### Rigid Body Center of Gravity Through Rotation
When a rigid body rotates, it's center of gravity moves though radius $r_G$.

The acceleration of point G can be represented by,
$$(a_G)_t = r_G \alpha$$
$$(a_G)_n = r_G \omega^2$$

It's inertia creates a moment of magnitude, $I_g \alpha$ equal to the moment of external forces.

#### Scalar Equations of Motion
$$\sum F_n = m(a_G)_n = mr_G\omega^2$$
$$\sum F_t = m(a_G)_t = mr_G\\alpha$$
$$\sum M_G = I_G\alpha$$

Using parallel axis theorem,
$$I_O = I_G + m(r_G)^2$$

We can cahnge the last equation to use $I_O$ instead of $I_G$.

### Procedure
1. Establish coordinate system
2. Draw FBD accounting all external forces and couples
3. Compute the mass moment of inertia
4. Write three quations of motion and identify the unknows
5. Use kinematics if there are more than three unknowns
