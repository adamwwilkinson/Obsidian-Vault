Like [[the work of a force]] but instead of integrating $F = m a$ with respect to distance, we integrate it with respect to time.

### Linear Momentum
$mv$ is linear momentum denoted as $L$. It is a vector that acts in the same direction as v.

### Impulse
Impluse is given by the change of momentum, or $L_2 - L_1$$

### Procedure
- Establish the x, y, z coordinate system
- Establish the direction of the particle's initial and final velocities
- Resolve the force and velocities into x, y, z components
- Forces as functions of time must be integrated to obtain impulses
