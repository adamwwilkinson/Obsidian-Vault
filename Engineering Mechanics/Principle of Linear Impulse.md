Like [[the work of a force]] but instead of integrating $F = m a$ with respect to distance, we integrate it with respect to time.

### Linear Momentum
$mv$ is linear momentum denoted as $L$. It is a vector that acts in the same direction as v.

### Impulse
$$I = \int F \mathrm d t$$

Impluse is given by the change of momentum, or $L_2 - L_1$

### Procedure
- Establish the x, y, z coordinate system
- Establish the direction of the particle's initial and final velocities
- Resolve the force and velocities into x, y, z components
- Forces as functions of time must be integrated to obtain impulses

### Internal impulses
The internal impulses always sum to zero as the internal forces between partivles always occur in pairs with equal magnitude and opposite direction.

$$\sum m_i(v_i)_1 + \sum \int_{t_1}^{t_2} F_i \mathrm d t = \sum m_i(v_i)_2$$

#### No External Impulses?
$$\sum m_i(v_i)_1  = \sum m_i(v_i)_2$$

Referred to as the conservation of linear momentum.
