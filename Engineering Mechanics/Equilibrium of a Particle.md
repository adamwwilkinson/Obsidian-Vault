### Terminology
#### Coplanar and Concurrent Force Systems
Coplanar is where all forces are in the same *plane*, forces are *concurrent* if they all have a common particle they are affecting.

#### Equilibrium of a Particle
The *sum* of all forces add up to **0**.
If a whole system is in *equilibrium* then each part of the system is in *equilibrium*.

### Free Body Diagrams
An drawing that shows all the external forces acting on the particle.

Active forces: forces that want to move the particle
Reactive forces: forces that want to resist the motion

#### Simple Springs
$F = k \times s$ or spring force = spring constant X deformation of spring.

#### Cables and Pulleys
$T_1 = T_2$ with a frictionless pulley and cable.

#### Smooth Contact
If an object rests on a *smooth surface* the surface will exert a force notmal to the surface on the object. So we get the normal force $N$, the weight $W$ and the force $T$.

### Moment of a Force
The *moment* is a point which provides a measure for the tendency of rotation.
$$M_O = F \times d$$

If we use the *components* of **F**, instead it is,
$$M_O = (F_ya) - (F_x b)$$

This difference in sign is because we usually consider *counter-clockwise* as positive.
