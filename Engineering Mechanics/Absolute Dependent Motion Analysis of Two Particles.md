### Procedure
Used to relate the *dependent motion* of particles.

1. Define *position coordinates* from *fixed datum lines* along the path of each particle. Different datum lines can be used for each particle.
2. Relate the position coordinates to the cord length. Segments that *don't* change with time can be left out.
3. If a system contains more than one cord, relate the position of a point on one cord to a position of a point on the other cord.
