### Definition
A *force does work on a particle* when the particle *undergoes a displacement* along the line of action of the force.

Work is defined as the product of force and displacement components in the same direction.
$$\mathrm d U = F \mathrm d s \cos \theta$$

### Work of Weight
$$U_{1-2} = -W \Delta y$$

### Work of a Spring Force
$$U_{1-2} = 0.5k(s_2)^2 - 0.5k(s_1)^2$$

```ad-info
1. The equation above is for *linear* springs only.
2. The work of a spring is not just force times distance, as the force changes.
3. Double check signage.
```

### Principle of Work and Energy
$$\sum  U_{1-2} = 0.5(v_2)^2 - 0.5(v_1)^2 = Fs$$ 

Written in **joules** where $1J = 1 N \ast M$
