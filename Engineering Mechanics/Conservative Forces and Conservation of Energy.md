### Conservative Forces
A force is said to be *conservative* if the work done is independent of the path.
$$\int F \mathrm d r = 0$$

#### Potential Energy
##### Gravity
$$V_g = W \Delta h$$

##### Elastic
$$V_e = 0.5ks^2$$

Always yields a positive value.

### Conservation of Energy
$$T_1 + V_1 = T_2 + V_2$$

Where T stands for kinetic energy and V stands for potential energy.
