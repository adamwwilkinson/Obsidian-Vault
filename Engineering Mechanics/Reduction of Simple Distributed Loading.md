### Distributed Loading
The load over a given surface area. The most common being a uniform load over one axis of a flat rectangular body.

### Magnitude of Resultant Force
Consider an element of length $\mathrm d F$.
$$\mathrm d x = w(x) \mathrm d x$$
$$F_R = \sum \mathrm d F = \sum w(x) \mathrm d x$$

$$F_R = \int^L_0 w(x)\mathrm d x = A$$ A here is the area under the curve.

### Location of Resultant Force
We give $\bar x$ to be the distance from 0 to the point where the moment generated from a force there is equal to the moment generated from the distributed forces.

The total moment around point O is given as:
$$-\int^L_0x \times w(x) \mathrm d x$$

$$\bar x = \frac{\int^L_0x \times w(x) \mathrm d x}{\int^L_0w(x) \mathrm d x} = \frac{\int^L_0x\mathrm d A}{\int^L_0\mathrm d A}$$

$F_R$ acts through point $C$ or the geometric center / centroid of the area under the loading curve.
