### Applications
Beams are structural members designed to support loads applied perpendicularly to their axes.

### Beams vs Members
Unlike members that squash and strectch under axial loads, beams bend under the axtion of transvers loads.

### How to Solve
Like [[The Method of Sections]], we tale a point along hhe beam and ensure the internal force are in equilibrium with the external actions
on **ONE** side of the cut.
