### Applications
Beams are structural members designed to support loads applied perpendicularly to their axes.

### Beams vs Members
Unlike members that squash and strectch under axial loads, beams bend under the axtion of transvers loads.

### How to Solve
1. Like [[The Method of Sections]], we take a point along the beam and ensure the internal force are in equilibrium with the external actions
on **ONE** side of the cut.

2. Sketch the FBD and draw the unknown $V$ and bending moment $M$ in the positive internal sense.

3. Apply the EoE and find the unknown forces.

### $V$
$V$ is the *internal shear force* that is the missing value when the equilibrium isn't satisfied.

Shear forces one either side of a cut have identical magnitudes in opposite directions.

## Shear Force and Bending Diagrams
The graph of the shear force is the derivative of the bending moment.

### Generalising Shear Force
If we said the cut was some distance $x$, we can get $V$ as a general formula with the term $x$.
