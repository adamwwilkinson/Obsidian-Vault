### How
In the method of sections, a *truss is divided in 2 parts* by taking an imaginary "cut".

### Steps for Analysis
1. Decide how to "cut", this is based on:
a) where you need to determine forces
b) where the number of unknowns does not exceed three

2. Decide which side of the cut to work with (minimise external reactions)

3. If needed determine necessary support reaction by drawing the FBD of the truss and applying EoE.

4. Draw FBD of the cut truss, indicate unknown forces at the cut members.

5. Apply EoE to solve for the unknown forces.
