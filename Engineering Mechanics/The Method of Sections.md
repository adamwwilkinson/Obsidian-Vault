### How
In the method of sections, a *truss is divided in 2 parts* by taking an imaginary "cut".

### Steps for Analysis
1. Decide how to "cut", this is based on:
a) where you need to determine forces
b) where the number of unknowns does not exceed three

2. Decide which side of the cut to work with (minimise external reactions)
