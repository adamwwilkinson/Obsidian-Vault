### Scalars & Vectors
Scalars purely have a magnitude, while vectors have magnitude and direction.

#### Resolution
The breaking up a vector into components. If the components aren't right angles, it may be useful to use the parallelogram rule, and the sine rule.

#### Summing Vectors
$F_x = F \cos \theta$
$F_y = F \sin \theta$

Do this for all vectors and find the resultant vector using Pythagoras' theorem.

```ad-warning
Remember the negatives for components.
```

### Relevant Trig Laws
Cosine:
$$C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos c}$$

Sine:
$$\frac{A}{\sin A} = \frac{B}{\sin B} =  \frac{C}{\sin C} $$
