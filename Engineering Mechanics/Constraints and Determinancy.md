### Statically Indeterminate
When there are more unknown forces to equilibrium equations.

#### Example Structures
![[Example Structures Drawing]]
1. Two or more non-collinear unknonw forces in a particular direction + one or more moment reactions
2. More than two unknoen forces in a particular direction
3. Two collinear unknowns in a particular direction
4. 4 or more unknown reactions

### Improperly Constrained
When there are too few forces to maintain equilibrium.
