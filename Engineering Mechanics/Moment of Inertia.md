### What
A property of a body that measures the resistance to angular momentum.

$$T = I \alpha$$

### Parallel-Axis Theorem
If the inertia of a body passing through a certain axis is known, the moment of inertia about any other parallel axis can be determined by,
$$I = I_G + md^2$$

### Radius of Gyration
Inertia can also be written as the radius of gyration($k$) and has units of length.
$$I = mk^2$$

### Composite bodies
The mass moment of inertia of a composite body can be determined by adding together all mass moments of inertia at the same axis, of the different shapes.
