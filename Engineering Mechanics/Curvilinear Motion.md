### Definitions
Position at an instant: a vector $r$ from the origin $O$ or a scalar $s$ both in metres. $r = r(t)$. Both the magnitude and direction may vary with time.
Displacement: the change in the particles position.

#### Velocity
Average Velocity: $v_{avg} = \frac {\Delta r} {\Delta t}$
Instantaneous Velocity: $v = \frac {\mathrm d r} {\mathrm d t}$

Acceleration: $a = \frac {\mathrm d v} {\mathrm d t}$

#### Constant Acceleration
$v = v_0 + a_ct$
$s = s_0 + v_0t+ 0.5a_ct^2$
$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a_c(s - s_o)$

### Rectangular Components
Motion of a particle is often defined in rectangular components,
$$r = xi + yj + zk$$

All these components can be functions of time.

The *magnitude* of a position vector is $r = \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)}$
The *direction* of $r$ is defined by the unit vector: $u_r = \frac 1 {\mid{r} \mid} r$

### Normal and Tangential Components
When a particle moves along a curved path, Cartesian coordinate may not be the best.
When a parth of the motion is known, normal($n$) and tangential ($t$) coordinates are often used.

In the $n-t$ coordinate system, the *origin* is located on the particle (the origin and coordinate system move with the particle).

#### Center of Curvature
The center of curvature $O^{\prime}$ always lies on the concave side of the curve.

#### Velocity
The velocity vector is always tangent to the path of motion (tangential direction). 
The magnitude is take by taking the time derivative of the path function.

#### Acceleration
$$a = \frac {\mathrm d v} {\mathrm d t}u_t + \frac {v^2} {\rho}u_n$$

$a_t$ is tangent to the curve while $a_n$ is directed to the center of curvature.

#### Radius of Curvature $\rho$
$$\rho = \frac {[1+ (\mathrm d y / \mathrm d x)^2]^{\frac 3 2}} {\mid \mathrm d^2y / \mathrm dx^2 \mid}$$
