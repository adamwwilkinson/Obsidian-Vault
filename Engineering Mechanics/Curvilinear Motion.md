### Applications
The flight of planes.

### Definitions
Position at an instant: a vector $r$ from the origin $O$ or a scalar $s$ both in metres. $r = r(t)$. Both the magnitude and direction may vary with time.
Displacement: the change in the particles position.

#### Velocity
Average Velocity: $v_{avg} = \frac {\Delta r} {\Delta t}$
Instantaneous Velocity: $v = \frac {\mathrm d r} {\mathrm d t}$

Acceleration: $a = \frac {\mathrm d v} {\mathrm d t}$

#### Constant Acceleration
$v = v_0 + a_ct$
$s = s_0 + v_0t+ 0.5a_ct^2$
$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a_c(s - s_o)$

### Rectangular Components
Motion of a particle is often defined in rectangular components,
$$r = xi + yj + zk$$

All these components can be functions of time.

The *magnitude* of a position vector is $r = \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)}$
The *direction* of $r$ is defined by the unit vector: $u_r = \frac 1 {\mid{r} \mid} r$
