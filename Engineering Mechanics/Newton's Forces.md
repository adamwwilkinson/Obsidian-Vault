### Newton's Laws
#### First Law
A particle originally at rest, or moving in straight line at constant velocity will remain at that state if the resultant force acting on that particle is zero.

#### Second Law
A particle experiences an acceleration in the same direction as a resultant force. This acceleration is proportional to the magnitude of the force.
$F = ma$ where $F, a$ are vector quantities.

#### Third Law
Mutual forces of action and reaction between two particles are equal, opposite, and collinear.

#### Law of Gravitational Attraction
Any two particles have a *mutually attractive gravitational force* acting between them.
$$F = G \frac {m_1m_2}{r^2}$$

This force is called the weight of the body.
