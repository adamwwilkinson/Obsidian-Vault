### What
When an object cannot be treated as a particle, and size or shape must be considered.

#### Planar Motion
Analysis will be limited to planar motion for now.

A body is said to undergo planar motion when all parts of the body move along paths equidistant from a fixed plane.

### 3 Types of Motion
- [[rectilinear kinematics]]
- [[curvilinear motion]]
- rotation about a fixed axis

#### Translation
If every line segment on a body remains parallel to its original direction during motion.

All particles in a rigid body subjected to translation move with the same velocity and acceleration.

#### Rotation
All particles of the body, except those on the axis of rotation, move along a circular path.

The angular position of a point is defined by $\theta$.
The change in angular position, or angular displacement is $\mathrm d \theta$, and is written in radians.

Angular velocity, $\omega$ is $\frac {\mathrm d \theta}{\mathrm d t}$
Angular acceleration, $\alpha$ is $\frac {\mathrm d \omega}{\mathrm d t}$

If acceleration is constant,
$$\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha_Ct$$
$$\theta = \theta_0 + \omega_0t + 0.5 a_Ct^2$$
$$\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha_C()\theta -\theta_0)$$

The acceleration of $P$ is expressed in terms of a *normal* and *tangential* components*.
$$a_t = \alpha r$$
$$a_n = \omega^2 r$$

### Procedure
- Establish a sign convention
- If a relationship is known between two variables, the other variables can be determined from the equations above.
- If acceleration is constant, use equations from above
- To determine the motion of a point, the equations above can be used as well
