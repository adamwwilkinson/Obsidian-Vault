### Application
The movement of a heavy object can be predicted.
For objects that don't rotate as they move we can model it as a particle.

### Definitions
Position: a vector $r$ from the origin $O$ or a scalar $s$ both in metres.
Displacement: the change in the particles position.

#### Velocity
Average Velocity: $v_{avg} = \frac {\Delta r} {\Delta t}$
Instantaneous Velocity: $v = \frac {\mathrm d r} {\mathrm d t}$

Acceleration: $a = \frac {\mathrm d v} {\mathrm d t}$
