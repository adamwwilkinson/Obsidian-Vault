### What
A couple is defined as two parallel forces with the same magnitude in opposite directions.
$$F = M_o D$$

The moment of a couple is a *free vector* where it can be moved anywhere on a body and have the same effect.

### Approaches
#### Scalar
1) Add the two couples to find the resultant couple
2) Equate the net moment to the total it should be and solve

#### Combining Forces That Act at Different Points
1) Find the magnitude and direction of the resultant force by summing up the components
2) To find the location of $F_R$ we find the moment of the previous forces, and place that $F_R$ at the point where the moments match

**Transmissibility**: a resultant force can act at any point along its line of action, without changing the external effect

$$F_R = \sum F$$
$$M_{R_O} = \sum M_c + \sum M_O$$
