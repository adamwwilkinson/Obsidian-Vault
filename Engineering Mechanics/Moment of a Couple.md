### What
A couple is defined as two parallel forces with the same magnitude in opposite directions.
$$F = M_o D$$

The moment of a couple is a *free vector* where it can be moved anywhere on a body and have the same effect.

### Approches
#### Scalar
1) Add the two couples to find the resultant couple
2) Equate the net moment to the total it should be and solve
