### Steady Fluid Flow
Provided the flow into the control volume is equal to the flow out, then it is classified as steady flow.

The change in direction of the fluid flow is caused by the impulse produced by the boundaries.

#### Linear Momentum
If we define a small change in mass as $\mathrm d m$ then,
$$\mathrm d m v_A + \sum F \mathrm d t = \mathrm d m v_B$$

#### Angular Momentum
$$r_A \times \mathrm d v_A + r' \times \sum F \mathrm d t = r_B = \times \mathrm d m v_B$$

### Mass Flow Related
$$\frac {\mathrm d m}{\mathrm d t} = \rho v A = \rho Q$$

#### Linear Momentum
$$\sum F = \rho Q(v_B - v_A)$$

#### Angular Momentum
$$\sum M_O = \rho Q(r_A v_A - r_B v_B)$$
