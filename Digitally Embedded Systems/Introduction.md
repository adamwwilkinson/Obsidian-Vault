### Digital
Comes from the word digit, *integer numbers* as opposed to *floating point*.

### Switches
All digital systems rely on switching between two logic states, **0** and **1**.

#### Mechanical
Complicated machiery were invented and built without electronics, just using mechanical parts.

They had a lot of problems, like being slow, large, unreliable, and expensive.

#### Electromagnetic Switches
The first automatic switches were *Relays*, and allows for electronic switching.

Silimar issues to mechanical switches, but faster.

#### Vacuum Tubes
Triode as electronic switching devices or amplifiears.
Faster and more reliable than relays.

#### Transistor
Semiconductor device, can be used as a switch or amplifier.

### Logic Gates
#### AND
Both inputs must be 1 for the output to be 1.

#### OR
At least one input must be 1 for the output to be 1.

#### NOT
Inverts the input.

### Microprocessors
A highly integrated general purpose digital circuitry with serveral inputs and outputs.

Cheaper, smaller, flexible and easier to use than discrete logic gates.

Changing the software on the microprocessor allows for different fucntionality.

### Moore's Law
Roughly every 1.5 years, there is a double in the number of components and speed. Every other technical system has only a few percent improvement per year.

This is due to *miniaturiazation* of components rather than any design improvements. Smaller components reduce signal runtime as well as allow more components to be packed into the same space.
