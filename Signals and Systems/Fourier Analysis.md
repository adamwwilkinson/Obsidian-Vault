### Fourier Representation of Four Classes of Signals
#### Fourier Series
- Periodic analog signals (synthesis, harmonies)

#### Fourier Transform
- Aperiodic analog signals (theory, investigating efficiency...)

#### Discrete-Time Fourier Series
- Periodic digital signals

#### Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
- Aperiodic digital signals

### Transforming from Continuous to Discrete
