### Ek Curves

The weird gaps where the wave number ($k$) is $\frac \pi a$ is because it is where the wave length is *a* i.e. the length of the gap between atoms. At some places it's sat right on the nucleus, where it's hard to escape or it's sat between two nucleus where it's quite easy to escape.

The difference in energy levels, changes the colour given off by the photon. We can change these energy levels by adjusting the length of the well.

### Fermi Level
![[Effects Of Periodicity-1679732343385.jpeg]]
With the left diagram there, at 0K, once all the electrons are filled in a metal, there is an $E_F$ which caps and prevents any more electrons. This is called the *Fermi level*. If energy is given to the system now, only those electrons at the *Fermi level* can raise higher in the band, as they've got the space to. Unlike the electrons below them.

This was one reason our classical [[Drude Model]] didn't work. As there, we treated electrons independent of each other.

```ad-info
When the Fermi level is in the condunction band, it is a condunctor. When the Fermi level is very far from the condunction band, it is an insulator. When the Fermi level is out the conduntion band, but very close to it, this is a semiconductor.
