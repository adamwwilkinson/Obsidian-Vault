### The Schrodinger Equation
Electrons are quantum particles. This means we can only describe them with their wave function.
$$\psi(x,y,z,t)$$
The equation
$$\psi \times \psi^*dxdydz$$ 
gives the probability the electron would be found at infinitesimal volume $dxdydzdt$ at position $(x, y, z)$ at time $t$.
