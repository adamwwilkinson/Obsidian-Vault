### The Schrödinger Equation
Electrons are quantum particles. This means we can only describe them with their wave function.
$$\Psi(x,y,z,t)$$
The equation
$$\Psi \times \psi^*dxdydz$$ 
gives the probability the electron would be found at infinitesimal volume $dxdydzdt$ at position $(x, y, z)$ at time $t$.

#### Solving Schrödinger Equation
We assume the particle has to be somewhere in space at a given time:

We also expect the particle to not fully disappear at any time, which implies:

A further requirement is the wave function is continuous and it's first derivative is continuous everywhere.

Assume the total energy $E$ is independent of position, and the potential energy $U$ is independent of time.

Assume $\Psi(x, y, z, t)$ is in the form,
$$\psi(x,y,z)e^{-jE\frac t h}$$

$E - U$ is kinetic energy

The second derivative is a measure of the wave-function and hence the larger the curvature the higher the kinetic energy.

### Unbound Electron Case
This is the simplest case to use the Schrödinger equation.

For a free electron, the potential energy is 0 everywhere.

The electron has momentum $p = \hbar k$ and this value is known.

```ad-info
$$k = \text {wave number} = \frac {2\pi} \lambda$$
```

This is what the wave function looks like in space.

The probability of the particle existing anywhere is $A^2$.
