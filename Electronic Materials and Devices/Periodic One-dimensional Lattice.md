### The Kronig-Penney Model
Crystals have a periodicity related to the location of the atoms each separated by a fixed amount in any given direction. Consider a 1-D model where the atoms are seperated by a distance $a$, the lattice constant.

Any wave function of the electron in the crystal will also have this periodic nature.

#### Model

Simplified as,

Any solution of our wave function has to be the same for each well as they all are identical situations. 

#### The Solution

The possible solutions are shown in light blue.

$l$ here is the seperation of atoms in the crystal.

As we go up bands the kinetic energy increases. 
$$K_E = \frac {p^2} {2m}$$

```ad-important
$n = 1$ is the case where the electron sits close to the nucleus, also known as the *valence band*. The top band is called the *condunction band* as it is most free of the pull from the nucleus, allowing movement.
