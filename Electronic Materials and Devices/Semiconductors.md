### Difference With Metals
The main difference with semiconductors and metals, is that semiconductors have a band gap. This is why as you heat up a metal it's conductivity decreases while if you heat up a semiconductor it's conductivity increases.

### Intrinsic Semiconductor
Has perfect crystal form, no defects nor impurities. At 0K, all states in valence band are full, and all states in conduction band is empty. No conduction under normal electric fields.

When an electron is promoted to the conduction-band, it behaves like a free electron, except its effective mass depends on the lattice. It leaves behind a positive 'hole'. The now free electron will drift under the influence of an electric field in the direction expected for negative charge.

The effective mass of the electrons in the valence band is negative, so they behave positive charge. This means they will drift in the opposite direction. This means these carriers also contribute to current, although with different drift velocities depending on effective mass.

```ad-info
In a intrisic semiconductor, for every electron in the conduction band there is a matching hole in the valence band.

In terms of the [[Density of States#Fermi-Dirac Distribution Function]] $E_F$ is halfway between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band.

A good semiconductor material has few electrons in the conduction band at room temperature (the band gap energy is large compared to the average thermal energy at room temp). For an intrinsic semiconductor, carriers in the conduction band are generated thermally, and the density of carriers is a random number. This randomness contributes to electrical noise in the device and should be minimised.

### Extrinsic Semiconductors
Adding impurities to a intrinsic semiconductor makes it extrinsic. When doping a intrinsic semiconductor with an element from a group above, there is a free electron left over. This is called n-type materials. P-type is made when doped from an element below.

The impurities make up only a small fraction of the atoms in the crystal.

#### Donors
These are impurities who leave a free electron when covalently bonded to the lattice. This positive charge is *immobile*.

#### Acceptors
These are impurities that create a positive hole in the lattice, as electrons try to fill up to create covalent bonds.

#### How to Dope
Grow a crystal of silicon, slice it up with a diamond knife to create silicone wafers.
The impurities can then be shot in.

#### Key Points
- density of holes and electrons are not the same.
- in n-type materials, electrons are majority charge carriers, and density of electrons are far greater than density of holes
- opposite is true for p-type materials
