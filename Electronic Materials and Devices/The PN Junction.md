In the P region a large negative charge is created and in the N region a large positive charge is created which creates an electric field.

There are two forces, the electrons moving due to diffusion, but the electric fields send them back again and in the end there is a balance. 

The movement of majority carriers are due to diffusion, and the movement of minority carriers are due to the electric field.

### Chemical Potential
Considering a layer of n-type semiconductor with density $N_D$, we also assume the density of free electrons match this.

The potential energy to cause movement due to population is called *chemical potential* $\mu^c$.
The chemical potential of electrons is $\mu^c_e$, and is defined as follows,
$$(\mu_e^c)$$
