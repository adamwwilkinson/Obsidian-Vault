In the P region a large negative charge is created and in the N region a large positive charge is created which creates an electric field.

There are two forces, the electrons moving due to diffusion, but the electric fields send them back again and in the end there is a balance. 

The movement of majority carriers are due to diffusion, and the movement of minority carriers are due to the electric field.

### Chemical Potential
Considering a layer of n-type semiconductor with density $N_D$, we also assume the density of free electrons match this.

The potential energy to cause movement due to population is called *chemical potential* $\mu^c$.
The chemical potential of electrons is $\mu^c_e$, and is defined as follows,
$$(\mu_e^c)_N = \mu_i^c + kT ln(\frac {N_D} {n_I})$$
$\mu_i^c$ is the intrinsic Fermi energy $E_i$, and is constant at equilibrium.
$\mu_i^c$ represents the amount of energy required to add an electron to a pure, undoped, crystal of a semiconductor, while $(\mu_e^c)_N$ is the energy required to add an electron to a crystal that has been doped by impurities.

It takes less energy to put a hole in n-type material than it is to put an electron.

The same maths works for p-type materials.

### PN Junction in Equilibrium

*Dopant ions*  cannot move because they are covalently bonded in the crystal.

The electric potential barrier will increase in magnitude until eventually it will balance the flow of holes and electrons caused by the chemical-energy difference.

A hole moving from n-type region to a p-type region increases the chemical potential energy, which a hole moving from p-type to n-type decreases it.

### Voltage
Combining the equations above,

Where $\phi$  is out built in voltage.

$$\phi = V_T ln(\frac {N_A N_D} {n_i^2}) $$
$V_T = \frac {kT} {e}$ is the thermal voltage which is 25.9mV at 300K.

Can also be written as,

### The Electro-chemical Potential

We can interpret this to mean
$$(\mu_e^c)_P + e\phi = (\mu_e^c)_N$$
