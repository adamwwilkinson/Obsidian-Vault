The wave packet is a model of a freely moving electron whose position is known in a finite length of space. The packet is described by the Gaussian wave function.

We can consider this wave packet to be a sum of many constant amplitude plane waves with different wavenumbers $k$ (Fourier tranform of $\phi(x)$).

The phase velocity of the component waves is given by,
$$v_P = \frac \omega k$$

The electron travels at the group velocity and is the velocity of the wave packet,
$$v_g = \frac {\partial \omega} {\partial k}$$

For a free, non-relativistic quantum mechanical particle of mass $m$,
$$E(k) = h\omega = \frac{h^2 k_0^2} {2m}$$

### Uncertainty Principle
$$\Delta x \Delta k = \frac 1 2$$

For a free electron, we had a single value for wave number or velocity, but we did not know where the electron was on the wave axis. For the wave packet, we have a better idea of where the electron is, but now we have a spread of velocities.

$$\Delta p \Delta x = \frac h 2$$
