### Situation
Consider a one dimensional situation where an electron is confined in a potential well such that $U = 0$ inside the well between $z = 0$ and $z = L$ and $U = \inf$ outside the wel.

We need to find a function that is 0 just before the boundary, and 0 after as the function has to be continuous.
```ad-note
Cosine functions are 0 every $\pi$, so it can be a solution to this. Sine waves as well can be possible solutions.
```

The wave equation must be in the form:

Any other energy value for an electron could not have a wave function to describe it, thus leaving its probability 0.
