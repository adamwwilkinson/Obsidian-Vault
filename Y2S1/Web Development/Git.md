### What
Git is a version control system to track modifications, protect source code, and allow for smooth work between teams.

### Git Flow
Nodes – represent change (commits + merge)
Master – branch deployed
Development Branch – used for development, used for compiling features
Feature Branch – used to develop features

### GitHub
Cloud service to store and manage code.

### Pull Request and Code Reviews
Pull request is where a contributor begins merging new code with the main project, can get feedback (more reviews, lower chance of bad code getting through), prevents bad code from getting pushed through

### Issues/Ticketing
Helps organise what issues to prioritise, helps with communication (assign yourself to the issue), helps stay up to date

### Conventions
Naming branches – i<issue number>-<issue description>
Meaningful commit messages – follow naming conventions from conventional commits
