# Python Coding Style
Style is the way something is expressed, is used to promote correctness, readability, and maintainability.
One example is that there should be **no more than 4 levels of indentation.**

### Functional Decomposition
Technique that involved breaking down large [[Function|functions]] into smaller ones.
- improves readability, maintainability, and efficiency

### Names
**Local variables**
- *only lower case*

**Wide scope variables** 
- given meaningful names

**Function names** 
- distinguish between *real* (named for what) and *procedure* (named for purpose) (see [[Function]])

### Comments
Programs and [[Function|functions]] **must have a docstring** which includes:
- role, author, date, and what it does
