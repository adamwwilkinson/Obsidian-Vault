### What
A graphical representation of a system's frequency response.

Often we have circuits with an input and output plot. We apply a voltage at the input and see what the responding voltage is. The network function called the transfer function is described in the laplace domain by,

$$H(s) = \frac {V_{out}(s)} {V_{in}(s)}$$

Generally we want to know how $H(s)$ varies over a range of frequencies i.e. $s=jw$. We are mainly focused on the magnitude for this unit.
