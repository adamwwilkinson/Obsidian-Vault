### Assumptions
*Circuit/Network theory* is based on the assumption all circuit elements can be [[Fundamentals Of Electrical Engineering#Lumped Circuit Abstraction | lumped]], although in the case they aren't lumped some can be solved with circuit theory.

#### Axioms
- the net charge inside the lumped elements forming a system is always zero
- electrical components interact solely through wires
- an element is described by only 2 directed variables
- the relationship between two variables are characteristic of the element and independent of all other elements in the network
- [[Kirchhoff's Laws|KCL and KVL]]

### Terminology
**Ports** - the pair of *terminals* on an element
