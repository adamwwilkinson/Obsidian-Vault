### History
Invented in 1948, and ushered in a new era of *solid-state circuits*.
Still used in modern day electronics.

### Types

### How It Works
![[Bipolar Junction Transistor-1682755506917.jpeg]]
The bottom half is forward biased, while the top half is reversed bias. This means, from the bottom, the electrons are pushed into the base. And the reverse bias creates a large electric field, which pulls the electrons out of the base into the collector.

$$I_C = \alpha I_E$$
$$I_B = (1-\alpha) I_E$$
$$\frac {I_C} {I_B} = \frac {\alpha} {1 - \alpha} = \beta$$
This means it can be modelled as,

### Characteristics
The common-emitter current gain $\beta$ is influenced by both the width of the base region and the relative doping of the base emitter regions.

A high value of gain is given by a thin base, with a lightly doped base and a heavily doped emitter.
