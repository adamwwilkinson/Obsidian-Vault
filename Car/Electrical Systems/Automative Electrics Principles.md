# Automotive Electrics: Principles

### Batteries
Creates electricity through a chemical reaction.

### Electro-magnetism
Passing current through a wire creates a magnetic field, and moving a magnet near a conductor induces a current. 
### Electro-magnets
If you wind wire around an iron core, and pass a current through it, you can make the iron strongly magnetic.

### Measurement
#### Voltage
*Volts* measure the potential difference between two points, analogous to two jars connected filled with differing amount of water.
#### Current
*Amps* is the measure of amps, analagous to the flow of fish going through the aforementioned jar set up. Can be measure by using a current clamp that measure current by measuring magnetic fields.
#### Resistance
*Ohms* is the measure of resistance, measure across two points.

#### Formula
This formula relates voltage, current, and resistance.
$V = IR$

### Power
Can be measured by *watts* or *horsepower*.
$P = VI$
