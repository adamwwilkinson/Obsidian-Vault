# Automotive Electrics: Principles

### Batteries
Creates electricity through a chemical reaction.

### Electro-magnetism
Passing current through a wire creates a magnetic field, and moving a magnet near a conductor induces a current. 
### Electro-magnets
If you wind wire around an iron core, and pass a current through it, you can make the iron strongly magnetic.
