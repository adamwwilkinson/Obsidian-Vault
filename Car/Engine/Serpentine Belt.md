# Serpentine Belt
Where a single belt powers all the accessories.

### Grip
The grip of a belt depends on its load, and it's surface area. Previously used the *V* belt, modern engines use a ribbed belt, which has smaller *V's*. Standard across the automotive industry.

### Tensioner
Has an automatic tensioner like on a [[Timing Gear and Timing Belt]].

### Standard Codes
First number tells how many *ribs* there are, last number is the effective length of the belt in *mm*.

### Problems
If the belt is slipping you may be able to hear it, it will affect the alternator so the battery warning light may come on. 
**Check at 60 000 miles**
**Replace at 90 000 miles**
If any accessory driven by the alternator starts acting up, check the alternator first.
