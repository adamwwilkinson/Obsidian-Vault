# Timing Gear and Timing Belt
### Timing Gear
Or timing set. Links the [[Crankshaft|crankshaft]] and the [[Camshaft|camshaft]]. Sychronises the [[Piston|piston]] and the [[Valves|valves]] for the 4 stroke system. Will use a belt, chain or gears for linkage. Consist of a pulley on the [[Crankshaft|crankshaft]], and a pair of pulleys (double the size) on the [[Camshaft|camshaft]] Includes an idle gear for pathing and a tensioner to keep the belt taut.

### Belt
Toothed belt to fit on the grooves of the pulleys, insuring timing is perfectly synced.

### Timing Belt
Also called cam belt. Syncs everything together.

### Installation
- use a wrench to orientate [[Camshaft|camshafts]]  to the right position.
- install [[Camshaft|camshafts]] pulleys
- install crankshaft pulley (tapered end facing backwards), make sure engine is [[Timing Gear and Timing Belt#Top Dead Center | top dead center]]
- tensioner, fits on the water pump, tighten as far out as possible to ease belt install
- install idler
- lock the crankshaft pulley by placing trigger wheel and round the belt tight on the right
- place a clip on the right pulley and work down
- tension then [[Water Pump#Installation| reinstall water pump pulley]]

### Tensioning
Align crankshaft to tension mark, and release the tensioner bolt to get the tensioner where it should be.

### Top Dead Center
Is when the number 1 cylinder is at the very top of it's stroke.
