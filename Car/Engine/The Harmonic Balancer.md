# Harmonic Balancer
The [[Timing Gear and Timing Belt#Timing Gear|crank pulley]], is also the harmonic balancer. Torsion occurs on the crankshaft from the powers stroke and leads to metal fatigue.

### Resonance
If these torsional vibration is equal to the natural frequency of the crankshaft, it can lead to a worse vibration due to resonance.

### Material
Rubber part of the harmonic balancer dampens this resonance. Can also be made of fluid.

### Life and Installation
Last a very long time in the car, connected to the car with 4 bolts.
