# Engine Block
Largest part of an engine, made of *aluminium* or *cast iron*.
Primarily used to house pistons. 
Also holds accessories powered by the [[Timing Gear and Timing Belt#Timing Belt|timing belt]].
Has holes for coolant and oil to travel through.

### Materials
- *cast iron* was used historically (tougher) - holes machined in
- *aluminium allow* (lighter) - cylinder holes made by liners

### Deck
- top surface of block
- between piston holes and deck is the [[Head Gasket|head gasket]]

### Oil Gallery
- oil pump pumps oil into the main gallery
- oil pressure switch or more modernly pressure sensor
- oil regulator (narrow hole)
- saddles (where [[Crankshaft| crankshaft]] sits) need to be lubricated
- oil flings on the inside of engines
- some have jets on the underside of pistons
- main caps are formed as part of the saddle upon creation\

### Core Plugs
Also called *freeze* or *expansion plugs*. Formed by emptying sand in molding process. Common place to *leak* as it is thin.

### Water Jackets
Cavity for [[Coolant|coolant]] to circulate around cylinders, also *reduces metal-metal contact* from heat expansion
