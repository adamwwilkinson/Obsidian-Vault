### Humanism
Considered the third force of psychology.
Bevahourist were interested in behaviours, psychoanalysts were interested in the unconscious, humanists were interested in the conscious.

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
- Physiological Needs: the need for food, water, and shelter
- Safety Needs: the need to feel safe
- Belongingness and Love Needs: the need to be loved
- Esteem Needs: the need to be respected
- Self-Actualization Needs: the need to fulfill one's potential

### Flaws
Pyramis suggests each need can only be satisfied after the previous need is satisfied.
It also fails to address transcendence.

### Transcendence
A loss of self-awareness and a feeling of oneness with the universe.
Acceptance of the world as it is.
Transcending one's dependency on others.
It is not a state we can achieve, but a state we can only approach.

### Deficiency vs Growth
Deficiency needs are needs that must be met to avoid unpleasant feelings.
Growth needs are needs that are not necessary for survival, but are necessary for self-actualization.
