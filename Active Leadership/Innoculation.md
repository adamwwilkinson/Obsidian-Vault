### What
Attitudes are often fragile and short-lived.
Some attitudes are protective and resistant to change.
Resistance is sometimes benificial.

#### Biological metaphor:
Weakened offending agent (a weak counter argument) introduced, motivating the immune system to produce antibodies (counter arguments) to protect against future attacks.

### Key Components
#### Threat
Refers to a recognition that an attitude is vulnerable

#### Refutational Preemption
