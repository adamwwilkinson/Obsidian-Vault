### Self-efficacy
A belief in your ability to perform behaviours required to achieve an outcome.
Differs in between level, strength, and generality.

#### Level
Varying degrees of task complexity

#### Strength
Degree of certainty an individual has to perform at a given level

#### Generality
Degree of transfer of efficacy belief from context

### Sources
- Past performance
- Vicarious modelling (when seeing someone else at a similar level to you do something)
- Verbal persuasion
- Physiological states

### Pitfalls
Self-doubt may be valuable from stimulating effort and protecting against complacency.

Needs to be developed in the right ways.
