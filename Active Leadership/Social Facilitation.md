### History
![[Social Facilitation-1682400427706.jpeg]]

### Evidence
- presence of others heightens physiological arousal only if task is complex
- when performing simple tasks, presense of others makes us perform them faster
- presense of others makes us perform complex tasks less accurately
- social facilitation had little to do with performer's evaluation apprehension
