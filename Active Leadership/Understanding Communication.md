### Self Determination Theory
Macro theory of human motivation.
Integrating content and process theories of motivation.
Three broad forms of motivation:
- Intrinsic Motivation
- Extrinsic Motivation
- Amotivation

#### Central Tenets
- Humans are inherently proactive with their potential and mastering their inner forces (such as drives and emotions)
- Humans have an inherent tendency toward growth development and integrated functioning
- Optimal development and actions are inherent in humans but they don't happen automatically

### Basic Psychological Needs
- Autonomy: the need to be causal agents of one's own life and act in harmony with one's integrated self
- Competence: the need to control the outcome and experience mastery
- Relatedness: the need to interact, be connected to, and experience caring for others

All three of these gives us intrinsic motivation

- Acknowledge and accept students' feelings and perspectives
- Provide a meaningful rationale for requests
- Minimize the use of controlling language
