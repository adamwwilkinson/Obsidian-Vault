### Tuckman's Model of Group Development
#### Forming
Group members are properly orientated towards the task. Involves establishing ground rules.

#### Storming
Intragroup conflict.
Lack of unity, people opt for safe positions that threaten the weak social cohesion.
Ambiguous group structure.

#### Norming
People accept other members idiosyncrasies. Roles and norms are established, and groups find out how to best work together.

#### Performing
The groups develop 'functional role relatedness'.
Interpersonal structure supports task performance as opposed to undermining it.
Roles are flexible and functional.

#### Adjourning
Separation as a group; This is important for the life of future groups.
