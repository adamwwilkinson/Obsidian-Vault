### Dilema
Soft Negotiation Styles
- Accommodating
- Avoiding
- Compromising

Hard Negotiation Styles
- Competing
- Any situation is a conflict of wills
- Often produces equally hard responses

### Principled Negotiation
Focuses on four basic points,
- People: separate the people from the problem
- Interests: focus on interests, not positions
- Options: generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do
- Criteria: insist that the result be based on some objective standard

#### People
Be soft of people, hard on the problem.
Three categories,
- Perception (Failure to understand the other side's point of view)
- Emotion (Negotiations are affected by how each side feels about the other)
- Communication (Negotiations are affected by how each side communicates with the other)

#### Interests
Focus on interests, not positions.

#### Options
Four things get away for generating options,
- Premature judgement
- Searching for the single answer
- The assumption of a fixed pie
- Thinking that "solving their problem is their problem"

#### Criteria
Insist that the result be based on some objective standard. (Preventing the shifting of goal posts).
