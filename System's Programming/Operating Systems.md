### What is an Operating System

#### User
The interface, the command interpreter, the directory structure, and to execute application programs.

#### Programming Environment
To enhance the machine, provide utility programs, to provide high-level input and output, to structure information into files, and to improve access to memory.

#### Efficiency
To replace the human operator, to schedule tasks, to store and retrieve data, to invoke and share programs.

#### Economic
To allow simultaneous use and scheduling of resources.

The OS must be extensible as new hardware and software consistently are being released.

### Traditional OS Services
**CPU Scheduling**: distribute computing time among several processes
**Memory Management**: divide and share physical
**Swapping**: move processes and data between rain memory and disk
**I/O Device Support**: provide specialised code to support device requirements
**File System**: organise mass storage into files and directories

*Utility Programs*: accounting, constraining resource access, manipulating the file system
*Command Interface*: textual or graphic to manipulate of os features
*System Calls*: allow constrained access to interior of OS
*Protection*: keeps processes from intefering with each other
*Communication*: allows groups to communicate within a single machine, and across networks
