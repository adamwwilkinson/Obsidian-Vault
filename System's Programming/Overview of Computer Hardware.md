### Central Processing Unit
Controls the computer itself, as well as handling I/O operations.

#### Handling and Data Fetching
The CPU *fetches* a copy of the contents in the MAR (memory address register).
Then depending on if the contents are a value or instructions, it either operates on the value as data, or carry out the instructions. Can also copy the contents in I/O devices.
