### Why
Language of choice for system-level programming, engineering, and scientific programming. C is used as the basis of the internet, as well as most operating systems.

C is the basis of all programming languages. It is extremely fast due to its lack of an automatic garbage collection system. Instead, requiring the programmer to reallocate space and memory.

#### Version
C11 is the modern version of C, with C89 being the limit of what can be compiled.

### POSIX
Portable Operating System interface, a family of standard for maintaining portability.

### Compile Time vs Runtime
We can either have task such as allocating memory in compile time or runtime. We can choose which period does the work, i.e. take more time to complete, to do these tasks.
