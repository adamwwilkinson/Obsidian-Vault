### What
Motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy for use elsewhere.

#### Parts
- rotor: rotating part of the motor
- stator: stationary part of the motor
- stator magnets: provides an opposing set of fixed magnetic poles
- armature: consist of a set of wire-wound coils, energised such that the opposing coils provide additive torque
- commutator: consist of a metal split-ring such that each segment if electrically isolated from the others
- the armature coils are attached electrically to the segments of the commutator such that opposing coils are energised oppositely
- brushes: provide electrical contact to the commutator segments

### Circuit Model
The conduction path is from one brush, through the commutator into other armature coils, then back out through the commutator.
Through this path there are three electrical paramters:
1. $R_a$, the resistance of the full path
2. $L_a$, the inductance of the full path
3. $e_b$, the back-EMF induced in armature windings moving in a magnetic field

#### Model Parameters
##### Motor Operation
Permanent magnets set up a magnetic field, with some flux density $B$, given by
$$B = \frac \phi A$$

Due to the field generated by the current in the armature coil ($i_a$), the rotor experices a torque,
$$T = k_T \phi i_a$$
Where $k_T$ is the torque constant. Given the magnets are permanent $\phi$ is constant as well. We will make $k_{TP}| = k_T \phi$.
$$T = k_{TP}i_a$$

If the motor is rotating at $\omega_m$, the power generated is,
$$P_m = \omega_m T = \omega_m k_{TP} i_a$$

The back-EMF generated is given by,
$$e_b = k_{ap} \omega_m$$
Where $k_{ap}$ is the armature constant multiplied by $\phi$.

The electrical power dissipated by this motor is,
$$P_e = e_b i_a = k_{aP}\omega_m i_a$$

If we assume $P_e = P_m$,
$$k_a = k_T = \frac {pN} {2 \pi M}$$
- $p$ is the number of magnetic poles
- $N$ is the turns per coil
- $M$ is the number of parallel paths in armature  winding

##### Electrical Domain Description
The load attached to a motor produces a reaction torque $T_L$ on the rotor, which is either
- constant, working a fixed load
- function of angular velocity

##### DC Steady State
The inductors become short-circuits, so the KVL becomes,
$$v_a - i_a R_a - k_{aP} \omega_m = 0$$

The mechanical side gives us the equation,
$$k_{TP}i_a = T_L + b \omega_m$$

### Analogue Speed Control
#### Constant Voltage Drive
Assuming DC steady-state,
$$T = \frac {k_{TP}} {R} v_S - \frac {k_{TP} k_{aP}} {R} \omega_m$$
The only non-constant in that equation is $\omega_m$.

If load is constant at $T_L$, the minimum voltage needed to move motor,
$$v_S = \frac {T_L R} {k_{TP}}$$

For any supply voltage,
$$\omega_m = \frac {v_S - 2T_L} {(2b + 1$)}$$

### Constant Current Drive
Tend to have a large $R_S$.

Torque is given by,
$$T = \frac {k_{TP} R_S} {R} i_S - \frac {k_{TP} k_{aP}} {R} \omega_m$$

If load is constant at $T_L$, the minimum current needed to move motor,
$$i_S = \frac {T_L R} {R_S k_{TP}}$$
