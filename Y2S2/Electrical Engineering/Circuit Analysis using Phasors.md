### Different Frequencies of Sources?
We can employ [[superposition-and-equivelent-circuits]] in order to find the solution.

If no additional information is given, assume both sources are in phase.

### Node-to-Datum Analysis
All node voltages must be phasor quantities, and those voltages are generally complex in value.

### Mesh Analysis
All mesh analysis must be phasor quantities, and those voltages are generally complex in value.
