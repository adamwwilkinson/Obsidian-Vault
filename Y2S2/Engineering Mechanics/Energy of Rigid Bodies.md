### Kinetic Energy
$$T = \frac 1 2 m (v_G)^2 + \frac 1 2 I_G \omega^2$$

#### Pure Translation
$$T = \frac 1 2 m (v_G)^2$$

#### Pure Rotation
$$T = 0.5 I_O \omega^2$$

### Work of a Couple
$$U_M = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} M \mathrm d \theta$$

If the couple moment is constant,
$$U_M = M(\theta_2 - \theta_1)$$

### Conservation of Energy
A force is conservative if the work done is independent of the path. Friction is a common non-conservative force.
$$T_1 + V_1 = T_2 + V_2$$

#### Gravitational Energy
$$V_g = Wy_G$$
Where $y_G$ is the height above the datum.

#### Spring Forces
$$V_e = 0.5 k s^2$$

#### Procedure for Analysis
- Draw two diagrams, one with the body at its inital position, and one at its final
- Compute the kinetic energy of the rigid body at each location, kinetic energy has two components: translational and rotation $0.5 m v_G^2$ and $0.5 I_G \omega^2$
