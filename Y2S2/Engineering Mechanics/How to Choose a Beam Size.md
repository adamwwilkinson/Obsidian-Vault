### Internal Stresses
When a beam is bent, the outside is in tension as it's side gets longer, and the inside is in compression.
The bending strain $\epsilon_b \propto y$ 
![[Internal Stresses Drawing]]

The constant to meet this proportionality is $m^4$.

$$\sigma_b = E \epsilon_b$$

### Calculating Max Stress
$$\sigma_{b(max)} = \frac {M_{max}y_{max}}{I} \leq \sigma_{all}$$

$I$ and $y_{max}$ are geometric properties and is given as $z$.
