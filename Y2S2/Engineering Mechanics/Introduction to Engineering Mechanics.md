### General Principals
#### Mechanics
When a body is affected by a force. Mainly focusing on *rigid* bodies.
#### Measurements
- Length
- Mass
- Time
- Force
Newton's 2nd law relates them all: $F = m \times a$ 
$a$ is a measurement of length over time.
$N = \frac{Kg \times m}{s^2}$

#### Models
We can treat a body as a **particle** when its dimensions are irrelevant to the orientation and magnitude of the forces applies to it.

##### Rigid Body
When dimensions are important and the deformation of an object is negligible.

#### Concentrated Forces
A way to idealise a force where the load is applied to a relatively small area.
