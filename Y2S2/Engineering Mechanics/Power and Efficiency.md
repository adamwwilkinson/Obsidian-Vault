### Power
**Power** is defined as the amount of [[the-work-of-a-force|work]] performed per unit of time.

$$P = \frac {\mathrm d U} {\mathrm d t} = F v \cos \theta$$

### Efficiency
The ratio of useful power produced to the power supplied.
$$\epsilon = \frac O I$$

Can also be in terms of energy.

In reality the efficiency is always less than 1.

### Procedure
- Find the resultant external force
- Determine the velocity of the point where the force is applied
- Multiply the forcce magnitude with the component of the velocity acting in the same direction
- Power can also be found be calculating the work done per unit of time
