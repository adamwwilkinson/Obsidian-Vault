### Three Equations of a Body in Equilibrium
$$\sum F_x = 0 \; \sum F_y = 0 \; \sum M_O = 0$$

### Two-Force Members
A solution can be simplified if we recognise members that are subjected to forces at only *two* points.

In this situation, the resultant forces must be equal in magnitude and act in directly opposite directions.

#### Steps
1. *Establish* a suitable x - y coordinate system
2. Draw a free-body diagram
3. Apply the three equations of equilibrium

### Three-Force Members
Equilibrium is only satisfied if the points are concurrent or parallel.
