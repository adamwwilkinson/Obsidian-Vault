### Key Points
#### 3 Phase Power
- apparent power, active power, reactive power, and power factor (VA, W, VAR, and PF) respectively
- Y-connections and Î”-connections of three-phase power systems
- relationships between line-line and phase voltage for both connection
- relationships between line current and phase current for both connections

#### DC Machines
- mechanism of DC machine commutation, armature reaction and starting circuit
- shunt excited, series excited DC machines: equivalent circuit, torque and speed equations, torque-speed characteristics curve, magnetization curve, armature reaction, and speed regulation, e.t.c.
- relationship between DC machine field circuit current and flux

#### Transformers
- transformer equivalent circuit and parameter determination (through open-circuit and short-circuit tests)
- referring transformer circuit from one side to the other
- transformer voltage regulation and efficiency
- transformer per unit representation
