### AC Brushless Motors
The problem with DC brushes is that they can very easily cause sparks that damage the mechanisms.

Can avoid this by using three phase coils surrounded by a rotor with a DC magnetic field.

### Syncronous Machines

External part is the stator, and the internal is the rotor with a DC magnetic field which is *locked* with the stator magnetic field.

If the stator moves out of sync with the rotor, then the motor will stall.

Sometimes the stator magnetic field might be rotating so quickly the rotor can't keep up. A slip ring (squirrel cage) can be added, that has conductive lines that can help provide a torque.

### Induction Machine
#### 3 Phase

Works similar to [[#Syncronous Machines]], however the rotor speed is **NOT** locked with the stator magnetic field. How does the stator create a rotating magnetic field?

Simply look for yourself and see.


The force of rotation is induced by the current within the squirrel cage.

#### 1 Phase
![[Pre Lab Information-1723603251117.jpeg]]Needs an auxilliary winding just to start the motor.

Main windings in alternate directions cause magnetic fields to go clockwise one way, and counter the other. 
##### Double Revolving Field Theory

##### Starting

When the rotor isn't moving, the forces cancel eachother out. Giving the rotor an initial speed (can be very small), can solve the problem. The auxilliary windings is injected with current from a capacitor, with the purpose to cancel one of the main windings, and strengthening the other.
